Self Bot (Against Discord Terms of Service)


# Against Discord Terms of Service!

Before using this, you have to remember that using a self bot is against the terms of service on Discord, and if you are caught using one you will be banned and have your account disabled. It is considered API Abuse and is not tolerated. I will not be updating this very frequently and I am not responsible for anything you decide to do with this. This code should be is use at your own risk and you can be punished for using it on your account.

# Setup

1. Before you can setup the bot you need to download Python. Once you have python installed you can either git clone the repository or download it.
2. When you've downloaded it you have to fill out the config.json file with your Discord Token (Search up a tutorial if you don't know how to get it) and the prefix you want (default is "n-").
3. After you're done with the configuration. Run the install.bat to install all the requirements. To start up the bot you need to run the start.bat file.
